# Hoxton Owl

The [Hoxton Owl](http://hoxtonowl.com/) is a programmable guitar effects pedal developed around an ARM Cortex M4 chip. The pedal is fully programmable, to allow users to create any custom patch that they require.

Recently, I have been developing some basic patches for the Owl, which can be found in the owl patch library - <http://hoxtonowl.com/patch-library/>. Developing some basic patches in C, with use of my DSP knowledge.

The Owl is a stable, reliable and fun piece of hardware to use and allows users an infinite number of different effects which can be bespoke designed for any specific applications.
