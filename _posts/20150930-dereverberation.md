# Dereverberation

I have been accepted to publish my MSc project on Dereverberation applied to Microphone Bleed Reduction.

I implemented existing research in reverb removal and combined with with a method for microphone interference reduction. In any multiple source environment there will interference from opposing microphones as pictured below.![2s2m](/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2s2m.png)

Research at Queen Mary University allows this interference to be reduced in real time processing and my project was to improve this with the addition of removing natural acoustic reverberation in real time, to assist with the microphone bleed reduction.

This work will be published at the AES conference on DREAMS (Dereverberation and Reverberation of Audio Music and Speech).
