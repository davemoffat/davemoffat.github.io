# AES Presentation on Owl Guitar Pedal

Martin Klang presented a talk on [Open Source Entrepreneurship and the OWL](http://www.aes-uk.org/forthcoming-meetings/open-source-entrepeneurship-and-the-owl/) discussing the [OWL guitar pedal](http://hoxtonowl.com/), creation through to production.

He discussed how the crowd funding sources, how to budget for small start up projects. The importance of open source, both in terms of software and hardware was discussed at length, and is a vital aspect of what the OWL team set out to do.

The OWL is a custom build programmable guitar effects pedal that allows anyone to write their own effect pedal and load it onto the standalone program. Effects can be written in C++, Faust or even Pure Data (PD). There is also a wrapper that allows users to run their patches as a VST or AU within a Digital Audio Workstation and in the future, it will also be possible to run patches in the browser. Recently a modular synthesiser version of the Owl has also been released.
