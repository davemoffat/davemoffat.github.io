# 360 Degree Sound Experience - Warsnare at the Albany

Having spent the past week working at the Albany in Deptford. We produced a 360 degree surround sound experience for Warsnare, a Deptford based DJ and producer <https://soundcloud.com/warsnare>.

27 Genelec Speakers and 4 subwoofers 5 different stages, with live performance spatialised and mixed in with pre-recorded and spatial elements were used to produce a fully immersive experience for a sold out audience, as such tickets to watch from the balcony were also produced.
