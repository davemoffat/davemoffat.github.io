# Propellor Sound Synthesis at Audio Mostly

Recently, at the Audio Mostly 2017 conference, my work with Rod Selfridge and Josh Reiss was published on Propellor Sound Synthesis. I was both published at the conference, on the conference organising committee, as a the webmaster and a member of the music team. More information is [available here](https://intelligentsoundengineering.wordpress.com/2017/09/12/physically-derived-sound-synthesis-model-of-a-propeller/) on the [Intelligent Sound Engineering Blog](https://intelligentsoundengineering.wordpress.com/), and an example of the propellor synthesis is [available on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChZBaKouRGs).
