# Teaching

Teaching has started again and I am once again a teaching assistant for Sound Recording and Production Techniques. On the 8th October, I was lecturing the class on Microphone Types, covering for the usual lecturer as he was away at a conference.

My teaching review from last year on the student feedback forms was 95%, so the hope is to maintain a high standard of student support and teaching throughout the course this year.

Teaching for this semester is for Sound Recording and Production Techniques, a MSc level course on studio work and audio. Next semester I will be developing labs and teaching on the undergraduate course Introduction to Audio.
