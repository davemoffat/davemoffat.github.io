# Digital Music Research Network 2019

DMRN this year, was once again hosted at Queen Mary. Their annual workshop on digital music research. This year, I attended, representing University of Plymouth, my new employer. We presented a poster on RadioMe, the new research project.

There were a number of interesting presentations at DMRN, including discussion on source separation, musical loop extraction, audio effect impact on musical similarity metrics. However, for me the star of the day was Cynthia Liem's keynote talk on ways in which we can understand and access data, that are totally different to common practices. It demonstrated the importance of ensuring we are measuring what we intend to, especially in a musical context.
