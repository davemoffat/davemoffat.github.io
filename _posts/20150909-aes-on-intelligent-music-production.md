# AES on Intelligent Music Production

Yesterday, the AES presented a workshop on Intelligent Music Production. The day started with a great discussion of the current state of the art of Intelligent Music Production, with strong indications as to where the future of the research will occur, provided by [Josh Reiss](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~josh/). [Hyunkook Lee](http://www.hud.ac.uk/ourstaff/profile/index.php?staffuid=senghl) presented some interesting work on 3D placement of sources in a mix, and how to separate tracks based on the perceived inherent height of different frequency bands. [Brecht De Man](http://www.brechtdeman.com/) discussed his PhD work on subjective evaluation of music mixing, and his path to understand how people go about producing their preferred mix of music, and how this is perceived by others.

Following this, Sean Enderby provided an energetic talk on a set of [SAFE tools](http://www.semanticaudio.co.uk/) produced at BCU for attaching semantic terms to presets for a range of audio effect plugins. Alessandro Palladini from [Music Group UK](http://www.music-group.com/brand/midas/home), presented their current work on “Smart Audio Effects for Live Audio Mixing” which included interesting work on multiple side chained and parameter reduced effects and new methods and tools to provide mix engineers, both in the studio and in live music scenarios. Their research is focused around providing an intuitive set of tools that remain perceptually relevant. Alex Wilson presented his work on how participants mix a song in a very simplified mix simulation and how the starting positions will impact the final mix that participants will produce.
