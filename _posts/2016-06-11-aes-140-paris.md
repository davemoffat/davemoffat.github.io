# AES 140 - Paris

Last weekend saw the [140th Convention of the Audio Engineering Society](http://www.aes.org/events/140/) — Europe’s largest gathering of audio professionals from around the globe, take place at Paris’ Palais des Congrès. From cutting edge research to fundamentals to practical application, the four-day technical program brings the opportunity to network with and learn from leading audio industry luminaries. Special events — including technical tours of premier production facilities and installs, student focused sessions and a 3 day manufacturer exposition round out the Convention. There was a particular focus on 3D and immersive audio at this Convention.

I was responsible for running all aspects of the student track of the convention, including Education and Career Fair, Student Design Competition, Recording Competitions and the Education Committee Meetings. At the end of the Convention I was promoted to Chair of the Student Delegate Assembly for Europe and International Regions.
