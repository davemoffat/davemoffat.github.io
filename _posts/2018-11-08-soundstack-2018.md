# SoundStack 2018

Last month was [SoundStack 2018](http://angelamcarthur.com/soundstack-2018/) \- This three day workshop on 3D and spatial sound was an excellent beginners introduction to 3D sound, and also a comprehensive overview as to ambisonic and 3D sound design, mixing and production.

The workshop, organised entirely by [Angela McArthur](http://angelamcarthur.com/), included highlights such as head tracking HRTF's and ambisonics (As pictured below), use of Max MSP and the [SPAT](http://forumnet.ircam.fr/product/spat-en/) spatial audio system, and a talk and workshop with [Call and Response](https://www.callandresponse.org.uk/), a 3D sound collective based in Deptford, London. People travelled from all over the country to attend the day, and it was thoroughly enjoyable.
