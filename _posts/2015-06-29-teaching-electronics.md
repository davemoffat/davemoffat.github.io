# Teaching Electronics

Today I was working down at Sutton High School, teaching basic electronics to high school pupils. They learnt how to wire up an [Arduinitar](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~andrewm/arduinitar.html), a arduino based electric synthesis guitar with analog and digital control. This is part of Queen Marys outreach program.

More information on the Arduinitar is avaliable here <http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~andrewm/arduinitar.html>
