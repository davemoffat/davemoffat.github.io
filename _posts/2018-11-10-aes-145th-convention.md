# AES 145th Convention

I have recently returned from the AES 145th convention. There were a number of interesting and inspiring talks. New dynamics audio effects for the android platform, further understanding as to the importance of phase in source separation - which is particularly important when looking at the state of the art in source separation, as it is primarily deep learning, which often suffers from inherent phase problems.

There was an interesting paper from BCU, entitled "**Investigation into the Effects of Subjective Test Interface Choice on the Validity of Results**" which promises to understand how a listening test interface and influence the results.
