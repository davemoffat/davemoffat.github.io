# AES-Warsaw

I have spent the past five days at the Audio Engineering Society convention in Warsaw, where I stood to become vice chair of the [AES Student Delegate Assembly](http://www.aes.org/students/sda/) for European and International Regions.

The Student Delegate Assembly representatives are a group of four students (two for European and International Regions and two for North and Latin America ) who support students who attend the AES convention, answer student queries, coordinate independent student events and student events at all conventions, represent the student members of the AES within the Education Committee and as part of the AES as a whole. Events run at the convention include [Student Recording Competition](http://www.aes.org/students/awards/), [Student Design Competition](http://www.aes.org/students/awards/), Student Party, an opening and closing student meeting, and an Education and Career Fair where institutions and companies can exhibit, promote and recruit to students for free. Whilst at the AES convention I also represented Queen Mary at the Education Fair, focusing on Queen Marys new [Sound and Music Computing MSc programme](http://www.qmul.ac.uk/postgraduate/coursefinder/courses/129308.html).
