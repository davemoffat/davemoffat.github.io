# Audio Feature Extraction Toolboxes

The features available within a list of ten audio feature extraction toolboxes is presented, and a list of unique features is created. Each tool is then compared to the total list of unique features. Each tool is also evaluated based on the feature coverage when compared to the MPEG-7 and Cuidado standard feature sets. The relative importance of audio features is heavily context based. To provide a meaningful measure of the relative importance of audio features within each toolbox, the toolboxes will be compared to their compliance with the MPEG-7 and Cuidado standards. The results of this can be seen below.
