# Visiting Researcher

Over the past month, I have been working closely with visiting researcher [Luca Turchet](http://www.lucaturchet.it/). We have been working on perceptual evaluation of synthesised footstep sounds. Within the experiment that we ran, participants put on shoes with sensors mounted in them. The sound of different floor surfaces and shoe types is then synthesised, through quality noise blocking headphones, and the participants are then asked to shape the spectral content with the aid of some very basic audio filters.

The intended outcome is to identify the extent to which different participants will vary the spectral characteristics of their footsteps.
