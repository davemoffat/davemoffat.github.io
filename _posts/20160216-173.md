# AES61 Audio for Games

The 61th International Conference of the Audio Engineering Society on Audio for Games took place in London from 10 to 12 February. This is the fifth edition of the Audio for Games conference which features a mixture of invited talks and academic paper sessions. Traditionally a biennial event, by popular demand the conference was organised in 2016 again following a very successful 4th edition in 2015.

**Christian Heinrichs** presented work from his doctoral research with **Andrew McPherson**, discussing [Digital Foley](http://www.audioforgames.net/2016/timetable/#DigitalFoley) and introducing FoleyDesigner, which allows for effectively using human gestures to control sound effects models.

I presented a paper in the [Synthesis and Sound Design](http://www.audioforgames.net/2016/schedule-papers/#Paper4) paper session, on [weapon sound synthesis](http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=18098) and my colleague **William Wilkinson **presented work on mammalian growls, both of which can be found in the conference proceedings.
