# Publication

It was announced today that my paper "Web Audio Evaluation Tool: A Browser-Based Listening Test Environment" has been accepted for the [Sound and Music Computing ](http://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/smc15/)Conference taking place in August.

This paper is a web audio API based development that provides users with a simple interface to construct and run perceptual audio evaluation experiments. Due to being browser based, there is no requirement for proprietary software, and it is easily extendable to any individual that can access a computer. It is set up so that no internet connection is required to run locally, or it can be hosted and post the XML output to a server.

This framework will give me an infrastructure with which to base all of me perceptual evaluation experiments which I will be undertaking in the next month or so.
