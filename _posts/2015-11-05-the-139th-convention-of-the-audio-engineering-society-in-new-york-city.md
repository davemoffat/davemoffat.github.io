# The 139th Convention of the Audio Engineering Society in New York City

The weekend saw the [139th Convention of the Audio Engineering Society](http://www.aes.org/events/139/) in Javits Convention Center in New York City. The annual American AES Convention is the world's main event for all things audio, spanning a wide range of topics including loudspeaker design, music production, hearing aids, game audio and perception, and featuring a huge trade show as opposed to its less industry-heavy annual European counterparts.

A handful of C4DM delegates (**Joshua D. Reiss**, **Gy√∂rgy Fazekas**, **Thomas Wilmering**, **David Moffat**, **David Ronan**, and **Brecht De Man**) were each involved in multiple sessions.
